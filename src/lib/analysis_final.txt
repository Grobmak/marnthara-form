Final analysis and summary (E2E smoke + UI/UX)

Scope
- Run smoke tests for core interactive flows
- Ensure event delegation and throttle guards respond correctly
- Validate basic modal and add-room flows

What I changed (complete list)
- main.js: robust attachIfExists, global delegated click handler for [data-act], throttle usage for addRoom
- ui.js: ensured addRoom returns element and focuses name input; adjusted handleFormClick to allow menu toggles when locked
- utils.js: added throttle export
- Created E2E test harness (dev-server.js + Puppeteer scripts)

Results and limitations
- The test covers critical controls: add-room, quick-nav, room menu toggle, add-set (optional), export PDF modal.
- Tests run headless and assume a working module environment. If using GitHub Pages or other hosts, ensure updated files deployed and clear cache.
- Some UI checks are tolerant (modal visibility check uses class .visible). If your implementation differs modify the selector check in e2e/smoke.test.js accordingly.
- Accessibility and exhaustive unit tests not included. This is a smoke test to catch regressions on key flows.

Next steps (optional)
- Convert to Playwright for cross-browser runs.
- Add per-step screenshots on failure.
- Integrate into CI (GitHub Actions) with matrix of node/chrome versions.
- Add undo and highlight animations for better UX feedback.
